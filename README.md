# Fablab-Kiosk-Interface
Prototype for a kiosk specially designed for people who enter a Fablab. The purpose is to gather info about them and their objectives, and also to study the flow of people who enter the Fablab.

Feel free to use the design for your own projects. This interface is meant to be changed and used by Fablabs who need to monitor their flow in order to improve their reach and services.

There is a User eXperience manual in this repository, explaining how to make this interface ready to both new visitors who never had contact with the Kiosk, and 'veterans'.

DESIGNED FOR 1366x768 or less (so it can be used with old disposible screens)
